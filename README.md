# HockeyStats

Java Spring App built as an assignment for my Server Programming course.

## Description

Pulls latest hockey statistics from EliteProspects API and renders them as a web app.

Stats can be sorted by goals, assists and penalties.

Site has two built in users: user and admin (passwords are the same. Pretty unsecure, I know :P)

## Try it out!

Unfortunately the EliteProspects API does not currently support HTTPS, so you will need to allow mixed content on your browser or run the app locally

In Firefox, you can change this setting by typing 'about:config' into your address bar and then changing the 'security.mixed_content.block_active_content' setting to false
